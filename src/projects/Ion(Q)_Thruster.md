**Description:**

Ion(Q) Thruster is an open-source optimizer and transpiler designed to outperform traditional Qiskit optimization techniques by leveraging the unique advantages of IonQ native gates. Our goal is to provide a high-performance, efficient solution for quantum circuit optimization tailored to trapped-ion quantum computing.

**Main Objective:**

Ion(Q) Thruster aims to:

- Surpass Qiskitâ€™s built-in optimizers by exploiting the full potential of trapped-ion systems.
- Optimize quantum circuits by reducing gate depth, minimizing error rates, and enhancing overall performance using IonQ's native gates.
