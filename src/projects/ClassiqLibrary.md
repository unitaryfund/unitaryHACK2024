# Installation
Working with Classiq's latest GUI requires no installations!

Just head over to [Classiq's platform](https://platform.classiq.io/) and follow the examples below over there :)

If you'd rather work programmatically, using Python, Classiq also provides an SDK, which can be installed as follows:
