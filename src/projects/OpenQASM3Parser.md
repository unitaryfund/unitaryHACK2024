`openqasm3_parser` provides a compiler front end for OpenQASM 3 language (OQ3).

In this document, this parser is referred to as `openqasm3_parser`.

Differences with the [OpenQASM reference parser](https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm) are
- The parser in `openqasm3_parser` is much more performant. A crude test with large source files showed parse time reduced by a factor of 80.
- `openqasm3_parser` performs semantic analysis.
