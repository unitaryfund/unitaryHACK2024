Graphix is a measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) software package, featuring
- the measurement calculus framework with integrated graphical rewrite rules
- circuit-to-pattern transpiler, graph-based deterministic pattern generator and manual pattern generation for flexible pattern construction
- resource graph visualization tools based on causal flow, gflow, pauli flow and pattern correction sets
- statevector, density matrix and tensornetwork pattern simulation backends with fully customizable noise models
- optical and superconducting QPU interface and fusion network extraction tool
