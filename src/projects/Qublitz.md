[Qublitz](https://qublitz-qubit-lab.streamlit.app/) enables students and other users curious about quantum computing to develop an intuition for computational principles by challenging them to navigate along the Bloch sphere using gates. Using a simulation of a two-state qubit, users will be shown how specific gates work and then be challenged to navigate to destinations along the Bloch Sphere to beat the challenge! They will learn to make their own gates by defining parameters for electromagnetic pulses sent to the qubit and explore the engineering behind quantum computation.
