## Feature highlights

* A block-based system for composing _**complex digital-analog programs**_ in a flexible and scalable manner, inspired by the Julia quantum SDK [Yao.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl) and functional programming concepts.
* A simple interface to work with _**interacting neutral-atom qubit systems**_ using arbitrary registers topologies.
* An intuitive expression-based system developed on top of the symbolic library [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) to construct _**parametric quantum programs**_ easily.
* High-order generalized parameter shift rules for _**differentiating parametrized quantum operations**_.
* Out-of-the-box _**automatic differentiability**_ of quantum programs with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) integration.
* _**Efficient execution**_ on a variety of different purpose backends: from state vector simulators to tensor network emulators and real devices.
