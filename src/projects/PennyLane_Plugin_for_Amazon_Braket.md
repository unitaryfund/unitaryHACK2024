The Amazon Braket PennyLane plugin offers four Amazon Braket quantum devices to work with PennyLane:

- `braket.aws.qubit` for running with the Amazon Braket service's quantum devices, both QPUs and simulators

- `braket.local.qubit` for running the Amazon Braket SDK's local simulator where you can optionally specify the backend ("default", "braket_sv", "braket_dm", etc.)

- `braket.aws.ahs` for running with the Amazon Braket service's analog Hamiltonian simulation QPUs

- `braket.local.ahs` for running analog Hamiltonian simulation on Amazon Braket SDK's local simulator

[PennyLane](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/) is a machine learning library for optimization and automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

[Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) is a fully managed quantum computing service designed to help speed up scientific research and software development for quantum computing.
